* Use class-java comes with a set of pre defined classes but we can create our own.

class MyCar {


}

* Use constructors to create the state of our class - if you do not create a class constructor
java provides one that does not allow you to set initial information.

class myCar {
  public myCar(){

  }

}

* Class details are stored in instance variables

class myCar {
  int modelYear;

  public myCar(int year) {
    modelYear = year;
  }

}

* Main method - Run when Java runs your program
public static void main(String[] args) {

}

* To use the class you need to create an instance

class Dog {
  int age;

  public Dog(int age) {
    age = age;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog dogOne = new Dog(2);
  }
}

* use extend to inherit
class Car extends Vehicle {}
